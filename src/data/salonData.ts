    summary: 'The ultimate guide to maintaining luscious South Asian hair density, preventing humidity frizz, and selecting salon-backed serums.',
    content: 'Indian hair is traditionally rich, thick, and highly textured, which demands intensive moisture retention. To prevent Hyderabad’s hot climate from causing frizzy flyaways, our hair styling division recommends three golden rules. First, opt for sulphate-free keratin shampoos. Second, always shampoo with lukewarm water rather than hot, which robs the hair follicles of natural lipid barriers. Third, incorporate a rosemary and argan botanical hair spa conditioning wrap monthly to repair structure and double the shine.',

    content: 'Getting that ethereal glass-like glow on your wedding day is a planned scientific process, not a last-minute miracle. At Saanvi Studio, we recommend brides begin their skin preparation 6 months in advance. Start with deep cellular hydration and light lactic chemical resurfacing facials. As you reach 3 months, introduce Collagen Lift microcurrent treatments to strengthen and sculpt cheekbone contours. In the final month, avoid raw extractions; instead, embrace soothing antioxidant and hyaluronic acid infusing therapies to maximize skin moisture lock.',

    content: 'A classic question every bride asks is: Should I choose HD Makeup or Airbrush? The answer depends entirely on your skin texture and the event environment. HD makeup relies on lightweight, light-diffusing formulas cream-blended into the skin with precision sponges. It is incredibly customizable and offers unmatched warmth. Airbrush makeup utilizes a motorized micro-mist nozzle. It is highly recommended for oily skin types, extremely humid wedding seasons, or outdoor venues, as it sits beautifully on top of pores and provides complete water resistance.',
